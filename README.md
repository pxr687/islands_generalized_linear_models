# Islands: Generalized Linear Models

## Idea
https://github.com/pxr687/islands_idea

Island maps: https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/mapgen4/


## To Do

* Move abstract modelling stuff out of lin reg page, onto 'what is statistical modelling' page (e.g. talk about systematic vs random components)
* Audience should be someone who has done statistics at undergraduate, but maybe doesn't remember it all
* Maybe consider pitching it at this level, so it requires less explanation?: https://towardsdatascience.com/generalized-linear-models-9cbf848bb8ab
* Short, snappy, clear - focus on estimation and interpretation - how the models work and what they mean - rather than model diagnostics etc.
